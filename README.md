# s21_LinuxMonitoring

This repository contains the implementations of two educational projects for School 21:
DO3_LinuxMonitoring_v1.0-0
DO4_LinuxMonitoring_v2.0-0

All scripts were written to run on Linux OS and tested on VirtualBox installments of Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa) and Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish), both Desktop and Server images.

For additional information on launching the scripts, their functionality and expected output, see the README files in the containing folders.
