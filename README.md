# s21_LinuxMonitoring

A School 21 study project - Linux basic bash scripting and system/file system research.
The script was written to run on Linux OS and tested on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa).
To start the execution of the script, call ```./launch.sh``` from the terminal.

The original task consisted of two major parts which were supposed to work and run separately. I combined them together so they would run as a single program. See the files in the **status_files** directory for the information the script should output.
