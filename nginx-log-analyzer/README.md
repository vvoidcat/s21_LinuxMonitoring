## log generator
***log_gen.sh*** is a tool for generating NGINX log files in the **combined log format** and filling them with (pseudo) data. \
The script will generate 5 new .log files or update the existing ones inside the **logs/** directory. These files will be filled with a random number of entries. 

To run the script, call ```./log_gen.sh``` from the terminal.

## log sorter
***log_sorter.sh*** is a tool for sorting the contents of the files previously generated by ***log_gen.sh*** and outputting the sort results to the console. The original files remain unmodified after this procedure.

***log_sorter.sh*** supports four output modes:
  1. sorts the entries by response code in ascending order
  2. displays unique IPs
  3. displays requests with errors (response code - 4xx or 5xxx)
  4. displays unique IPs found among the erroneous requests

To run the script, call ```./log_sorter.sh [ 1-4 ]``` from the terminal.

## log analyzer
***log_analyzer.sh*** is a tool for further analyzing the data in the logs previously generated by ***log_gen.sh***. It uses the *goaccess* utility to generate a detailed visual report in a form of .html page. If the user doesn't have the required utility installed on the machine, ***log_analyzer.sh*** will prompt its installation.

To run the script, call ```./log_analyzer.sh``` from the terminal.
