# system-researcher

This directory contains a tool for displaying basic **system** (hostname, uptime, current timezone, ip address, etc.) and **filesystem** (total number of files, total number of directories, etc.) information in the console. \
The tool allows customization of its console output with several color scheme variations and supports optionally storing the acquired system information on the machine in the form of **.status** text files.

See the provided files in the **example-files/** directory for the exact information the script should output.

To start the execution of the script, call ```./researcher.sh``` from the terminal.
